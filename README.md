Hi everyone, I'm Maria Francesca Pulella and I'm a master's student from the course Corporate Communication (Università degli Studi di Milano).

That's Amore is an Italian restaurant from Lausanne. The refactoring of this website has the goal to improve the design of it in order to make it more attractive and user-friendly.

To do it I used:
- Google Fonts
- VS Code for the HTML, CSS, JS and the MarkDown file of the pitch
- Canva
- CapCut
- Freepik to find images

Here it is the link of my website: https://mfpulella.github.io/webcomm-mariafrancesca-pulella/
