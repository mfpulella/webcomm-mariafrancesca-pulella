That's Amore is an Italian restaurant from Lausanne. The refactoring of this website has the goal to improve the design of it in order to make it more attractive and user-friendly.

To do it I used:
- Google Fonts
- VS Code for the HTML, CSS, JS and the MarkDown file of the pitch
- Canva
- CapCut
- Freepik to find images
